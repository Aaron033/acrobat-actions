Actions and Custom Commands for Adobe® Acrobat® Pro DC

## Compatibility with Adobe® Acrobat®

Use files in "zh-cn" for Acrobat® Pro DC 2015 in Simplified Chinese; use files in "en" for Acrobat® Pro DC 2015 in English. For Acrobat® Pro in other UI languages, some keywords in the actions may have to be changed.

The (Custom) Commands are new features since DC 2015, as single-step Actions. They're not supported in XI and prior versions.

## Usage

The main entry is Action Wizards (动作向导) in Acrobat Pro, where you can import Actions and Custom Commands.

To import a toolset into Acrobat DC, simply open that file (`*.aaui`).

NOTE: Some Actions and Commands require special Preflight profile (in this repository), which must be also imported.

## Forthcoming

I'll preprare all Actions and Custome Commands for English version, exported from Acrobat® Pro DC 2017 (Windows, English).
